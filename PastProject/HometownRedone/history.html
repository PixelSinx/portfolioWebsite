       There used to be a big turkey industry in Frazee, with a turkey hatchery and processing plant in the city.
       A lot of the farmers in the area used to raise turkeys, and this can still be seen somewhat as there are still farmers in the area
       that raise them, and there are still old barns in the area that were used for this practice.

      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Turkey Statue">  
        The big turkey statue that resides in the outskirts of the town symbolizes the turkey industry that used to be big part of Frazee.
        The new statue which you see when you visit today was constructed after the original one burned down, after a spark chaught the paper
        mache body on fire while maintnence crews were using a blowtorch to do maintnence on the metal frame of the statue.

      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="R. Frazee">  
        Randolph Lafayette Frazee is the person for which the city is named after. He was born on July 3rd, 1841, in Hamden Ohio.
        He purchased a sawmill in the area and after operating it for a few months, he decided to start developing the area around it into a small town.
        He built a flour mill in northen Minnesota in 1889, which would burn down later that year.
        In 1890, he sold all of his mill property away to A. H. Wilcox who eventually rebuilt the old mill later that year.
        Randolph then later died in his home on June 4th, 1906 from a heart disease.
