        <h3>Updates</h3>
        <h3>Project #1</h3>
    <p>In the first Photoshop Project, I was tasked to create two movie posters. The first poster was supposed to be based around a doomsday scenario, and the second one was supposed to be based around the first U.S. Airborne unit (the 501st). This unit was trained to parachute into battle during World War II.
