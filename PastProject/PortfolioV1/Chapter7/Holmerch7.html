    <h1><strong>Blog</strong> Brody Holmer</h1>
    <h1 id="title">Blog Project: Blogs, Projects and More!</h1>
    <p>Hey guys, I'm working currently working on building a personal web blog, Here's some of the ideas I have for the blog.</p>
    <p class="sidebar">To summarize in these chapters I learned how to format and move items around on a page, and how to easily format different parts of a webpage easily with different styles.</p>
    <h2>Updates to projects</h2>
    <p>I'll be posting updates to any projects that I'm working on, so check back often to see whats happening with all of the projects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Home</li>
        <li>Project Blog</li>
        <li>Personal Blog</li>
        <li>About</li>
        <li>Contact</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pages</h3>
    <p>Here are the pages that I'm planning on having for the webpage. This will allow me to more easily organize the website into different sections so that each user can find what they are looking for quickly.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Personal updates</h3>
    <p>I'll be posting some updates to anything personal that I want to share with you guys, so make sure to come back and check up on what I've been doing lately.</p>
