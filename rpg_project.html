        <p>This page was designed to show all of the assignments I did in my RPG class.</p>                 
    </div>
    
    <div class="redux2">
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #1">
        <div id="featInfo">
    <a href="images/rpg/rpg1.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg1.jpg" alt="RPG #1"/></a>
        
    <p>In the first RPG assignment, I wrote a program that outputs the information stored in a file.    
    </p>
    </div>
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #2"> 
      <div id="featInfo">
    <a href="images/rpg/rpg2.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg2.jpg" alt="RPG #2"/></a>
        
    <p>In the second RPG assignment, I wrote a program that checks how much of each product is available, and if it is less than or equal to 20, it outputs that more product is needed.<br> 
    </p>
    </div>  
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #3">  
      <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/rpg3.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg3.jpg" alt="RPG #3"/></a>
        
    <p>In the third RPG assignment, I wrote a program that calculates a customers total profits, profit %, and if the customer sales people got a bonus based on the profit amount.     
    </p>
    </div> 
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #4"> 
      <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/rpg4.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg4.jpg" alt="RPG #4"/></a>
                
    <p>In the fourth RPG assignment, I wrote a program that calculates how many overtime hours an employee has worked, then calculates how much the employee made in overtime pay, and than calculates the final gross pay.     
    </p>
    </div>  
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #5"> 
       <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/rpg5.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg5.jpg" alt="RPG #5"/></a>         
    <p>In the fifth RPG assignment, I wrote a program that calculates the amount on hand and compares it to the minimum amount to be kept on hand,
    it then calculates how many items need to be ordered, and also if any need to be rush ordered. At the end the program totals all of the order amounts up into one big total.
    </p>
    </div> 
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #6"> 
       <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/rpg6.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg6.jpg" alt="RPG #6"/></a>         
    <p>In the sixth RPG assignment, I wrote a program that calculates a customers profits, then calculates 2 different bonuses based on the amount of profit. The program then
    calculates to figure out if the customer got the maximum amount of bonus on 1, 2, or even none of the bonus amounts.
    </p>
    </div> 
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Assignment #7"> 
       <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/rpg7.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/rpg7.jpg" alt="RPG #7"/></a>         
    <p>In the seventh RPG assignment, I wrote a program that calculates a players catches, yards, and yards per catch, while also totaling them all up for each team, the program also calculates if the yards per catch is high
    enough to warrant the title of all pro receiver.
    </p>
    </div> 
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="THINK"> 
       <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/think.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/think.jpg" alt="RPG Think"/></a>         
    <p>In the RPG THINK assignment, I wrote a program that checks how much of each item was in stock, on reserve, allocated, on order, and sold. The program then used all of this information, including the minimum allowance, to calculate how much needs to be
    ordered, and also how much of that needs to be ordered so that it shows up the next day.
    </p>
    </div> 
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="LAST"> 
       <div id="featInfo">
        <a href="images/rpg/last.jpg">
    <img src="imageThumbnail/rpg/last.jpg" alt="RPG Last"/></a>         
    <p>In the RPG LAST assignment, I wrote a program that how much a customer made in profit, how much was given out as commission, and also how much of that commission was taxed. The program also didn't show any customers that didn't make over $500 in profit.
