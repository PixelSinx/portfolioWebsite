        <h2 id="headline">Portfolio Project Redux</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Redux of the Portfolio Project, which was the first web development project that I completed. I felt that the site needed a bit of facelift, and since I've learned a lot since then, I decided to do a redux of the UI and layout for the site, while also testing out some new features.</p>
        <strong><p>Click through the sections below to see what has changed.</p></strong>
  
     <div class="redux2">
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Home">
        The Home page was changed to have less redundant clutter (and images), this was achieved by removing the last project and blog sections that already had separate sections, and were not critically important to the home page.
        I also added a tabbed interface that talks about all of the changes that have happened around the site.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Nav"> 
        The Nav bar was moved from the top of the screen, to a sidebar that pops in and out of the screen when hovered over (or tapped on for touchscreens). This also made it easier to allow the nav bar to scroll alongside the page if needed.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="General UI">  
        I changed the color scheme, removed a lot of redundant images and links, and also added rounded edges alongside the central wrapper, footer and images.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Contact"> 
        A form was added to the contact page. You currently still have to click the mail link to actually contact me though (server side not coded).
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Project Pages"> 
        The project pages were changed from their original sections of scrolling through the chapters with header, to using a tabbed interfaces. This allowed us to do less scrolling then before, and made it easier for the user to navigate
        and follow along through a project. I also added links to any of the project sites, so that you can explore them on your own.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Scripts"> 
        Some Javascripting was done to add more functionality to the site, like the side navigation bar that pops in and out, a date feature at the bottom of the screen and also making it so all external links open in a new tab.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Responsive"> 
        The new interface was made with a responsive website in mind, which will make it easier to allow the site to scale to different devices, without affecting any of the functionality or look of the site.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="Skeleton CSS"> 
        I'm testing out the skeleton framework on both the News page, and the Blog page.
      </div>
      <div class="redux" data-tab-title="More Projects"> 
        More project pages have been added, including work I did with Visual Basic, C++, Python, RPG, and more!!!
      </div>
